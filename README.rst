=======
PyRinex
=======

RINEX 3 and RINEX 2 reader in Python -- reads NAV and OBS files into ``xarray.Dataset`` for easy use in analysis and plotting.

Writes to NetCDF4 (subset of HDF5).
This is couple order of magnitude speedup in reading and allows filtering/processing of gigantic files too large to fit into RAM.

Install
=======
::

  python -m pip install -e .

Usage
=====
Read RINEX3 or RINEX 2  Obs or Nav file::

  python ReadRinex.py myrinex.XXx


read Obs
--------

.. code:: python

    import pyrinex

    obsdata,header = pyrinex.rinexobs('tests/demo.10o')

This returns a 4-D xarray DataArray of data within the .XXo observation file.
Indexed by measurement x SV x time x signal

read Nav
--------

.. code:: python

    import pyrinex

    navdata = pyrinex.rinexnav('tests/demo.10n')

    navdata = pyrinex.rinexnav('tests/demo_MN.rnx')

This returns a 2-D array of the data within the RINEX 3 or RINEX 2 Navigation file.
Indexed by time x quantity



RINEX OBS reader algorithm
==========================
1. read overall OBS header (so we know what to expect in the rest of the OBS file)
2. fill the xarray.Dataset with the data by reading in blocks -- another key difference from other programs out there, instead of reading character by character I ingest a whole time step of text at once, helping keep the processing closer to CPU cache making it much faster.
